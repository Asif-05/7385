Waterfall 

    - sequential or linear development model


    - every stage will be completed before moving to the next stage


    - it is a time consuming model

   
    - it is not dynamic


    - immediate results can't be generated

    
    - it can't take any changes in between

   
   

Agile Manifesto  (12 principles)


     - people over processes

            - we initiate improved communication

            - direct communication with the client

            - meeting happens on wweekly, daily basis

            

     - working software

            - RAD prototyping is done

            - Rapid Application Development(RAD)

            - prototype is a model of a proposed system


     - customer collaboration

            - through product owners the customer can collaborate closely

            - face to face interactions

            - for clarification meeting happens regularly with the client 

            - product owner represent the client needs

                                  


     - responding to changes 

                - welcome the client's need

                - incorporate the changes demanded by the client

                - delivery of product in a short duration of time

                - following a flexible approach

         

Flexible, dynamic and reliable 


SCRUM

    - it is an agile framework


    Five stages in SCRUM

       - Sprint Planning

              - Sprint is an iteration (1 to 5 weeks duration) 

              - Agile project has Multiple Sprints 

              - gap between one sprint and another sprint is called timeboxing

       - Daily stand up meeting and artifacts updated

              - here people will be allocated with tasks

              - lesson we learnt from  project or takeaways 

              - 


       - Review

              - formal meeting with the team



       - Retrospect

             - analyze what we have done so far in the project
    
             - past activities in the project

       - No changes (execute sprint)


             - meet the deadlines of project

            

SCRUM master  - he takes care of the entire scrum activities


Product owner - he is the voice of customer , represent the customer

Sprint backlog - pending sprints to be executed

Product backlog - pending tasks to be completed 



The needed tasks will be moved from product backlog to sprint backlog



Scrum master

      - Good communication skills

      - conflict resolving

      - interpersonal skills

      - leadership skills are very important

      - monitoring and controlling 

      - feedbacks to improve the performance of the team

      - give importance to quality 


Product Owner
  
     - works like a point of contact for entire team

     - he represents the client needs

     - incharge of succeess of the product

     - collaborates with all in the team



Sprint Planning

      Product backlog

        - pending task to be completed

      Team Structure and Capabilties

        -  skill set of team members

      Business condition

        - based on requirements

Sprint

   Sprint  Backlog 
   
         - Pending sprints to be executed

  Burndown 

        - it shows a report based on sprints and it's completion time

        - graphical reprensentation

        - 7 days to 30 days

  Daily Scrum Stand Up Meeting

        - On a daily basis

        - task will be allocated 

        - Decision making


  Sprint Review meeting

        - Review meeting

        - informal 

  Sprint retrospective

        - checking or analysing the past activities

        - process improvement

        - scrum master responsibility

        - priortize the tasks

        -        

Extreme Programming


     - high quality software is produced keeping customer in mind

    Best practices

      - Pair wise programming

            - here the tester will fix the bug and the developer will perform regression testing

      - Continuos process
           
            - no delays are allowed 

            - developer and tester take turns in completing the task

       - Coding standards
  
            - ISO standard will be implemented for any programming language or databse
 
            - naming conventions and coding standards           

       - Test Driven Develoment(TDD)


              - we write test cases before coding

FDD

     - Feature driven development

Lean software development

      -  eliminate the wastages

      -  fast delivery 

      -  improved productivity

      -  cost effective solution

      -  optimize whole system

SCRUM VS KANBAN


   - SCANBAN

         framework which is a combination of both

         Scrum is more technical than Kanban

         Kanban is very simple to follow because no sprints are followed

Kanban board

      - it shows the flow of work in progress

      - provides easy access to team members

      - progress can be displayed visually

      - bottlenecks can be easily identified

Agile Metrics

      - to measure the agile process

      - to improve the productivity

      


1. Sprint Burndown chart


       - no of sprints in a scrum project
 
       - how much time taken to complete

       - it is represented as a report


2. Velocity


       - average time taken by the team in a sprint

       - measured in hours, minutes

       - the velocity should increase

       - if it decreases then it means the performance is degraded

3. Epic and Release burndown chart


       - it deal with epic

       - track the progress

       - it is prepared for each sprint


4. Control Chart 

      - it focuses on time duration between "In progress and Complete Status"

5. Cummulative flow diagram

      - time duration taken for executing the flow diagram

      - X axis deals with time
 
      - Y axis deals with issues


6. Lead time
       - time taken between making a request to completing a request

       - from defining the requirement till bug fixing

7. Value Delivered

       - assign the priority value for each requirement

       - based on severity level the priority is assigned

       
8. Work item age

      - the time duration between starting a task and completing a task

      - it is used for identifying the unfinished task

9. Throughput

      - avearge task completion per time unit
